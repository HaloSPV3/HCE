# Attributions

Although this project does not directly interact with the respective shader effects, we believe it is fair to include
the licenses for the shader effects that are distributed with the official copy of SPV3.2.

The [`docs/SHADER_LICENSES.md`](doc/SHADER_LICENSES.md) document handles the shader effects' attributions and licences.

Note that the licence used for SPV3.Settings does not extend to any shader effect that is utilised by the official copy
of SPV3.2. As such, the source code and/or binaries for the shader effects are not included in the official repository
for SPV3.Settings.
