# Introduction

SPV3.Settings serves as the prettier and simpler version of HCE.BalsamV, with its design and functionality catering to
the scope of SPV3.

The options unrelated to SPV3 (e.g. Network Settings & Player Information) have been taken out of the GUI, in favour of
buttons used to launch external configuration applications such as the OpenSauce & shader settings.
