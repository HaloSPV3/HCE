# Introduction

This repository contains the source code and specification for the SPV3.2
installer, which aims to serve as a flexible & robust installer.

Refer to the [Specification](doc/specification.md) document for information
on the domain entities & business logic of the SPV3 installer & compiler.

The installer relies on a _metadata_ file to install _packages_. For creating
both of these, refer to the [Compilation](doc/compilation.md) documentation.
