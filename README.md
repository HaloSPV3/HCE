# Introduction

SPV3.Settings is the configuration program used for tweaking SPV3. The program serves as a front-end to configuring:

- SPV3's video/audio/input settings;
- various post-processing shader effects;
- environmental sound & hardware acceleration;
- OpenSauce post-processing options/effects.

This program is designed to deal with options within the scope of SPV3. It abstracts the generalised routines of the
various libraries away from the end-user, and exposes only the necessary options that are relevant to SPV3.
